function [y] = my_conv(x,h)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A function to generate the output signal y as convolution of input signal
% x and impulse response signal h
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% INPUT PARAMETERS---------------------------------------------------------
% x: input signal
% h: impulse response

len_x = length(x); % length of x
len_h = length(h); % length of h






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Data processing: convolution (TO BE COMPLETED BY STUDENTS)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUT PARAMETERS--------------------------------------------------------
% y: output signal as convolution of input signal x and impulse response h

% Write the code including comments to explain what you are doing




% If you want to check if the code works fine, you can comment all your
% code and replace it with
%             y = conv(x,h)
% which is a built-in function in matlab. The result should be the same.
